Create a python program that reads the ages of all of the guests in a group from the user, with one age entered on each line. The user will enter a blank line to indicate that there are no more guests in the group. Then your program should display the admission total cost for the group. The cost should be displayed using two decimal places.

Manila Zoo determines the price of admission based on the age of the guest.
The table below shows the summary of prices
